[A352881](https://oeis.org/A352881)		a(n) is the minimal number z having the largest number of solutions to the Diophantine equation 1/z = 1/x + 1/y such that 1 <= x <= y <= 10^n.

[A347105](https://oeis.org/A347105)		a(n) is the greatest sum of the digital roots of the individual factorizations of n.

[A355069](https://oeis.org/A355069)		a(n) is the number of solutions to x^y == y^x (mod p) where 0 < x,y <= p^2 - p and p is the n-th prime.

[A355419](https://oeis.org/A355419)		a(n) is the number of solutions to x^y == y^x (mod p) where 0 < x,y <= p and p is the n-th prime.
